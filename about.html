    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>The Family Cup began as a dream shared around the kitchen table. Years ago, Rob and his grandfather would sit together over a cup of hot chocolate and coffee in a Memphis bookstore, planting the seed of a dream to one day create a space where families could gather and connect. That dream became a family mission—something we put on paper, talked about over dinner, and continued shaping through every chapter of life. Today, The Family Cup is a family-run coffee trailer built on kindness, connection, and purpose.</p>

    <h2>Our Coffee</h2>
    <p>All of our beans are organically grown, ethically sourced, and roasted by <strong>Dr. Beans Coffee Roasters</strong>. They’re deeply committed to sustainable relationships with farmers and small-batch roasting that brings out the full richness of each bean. It’s coffee we proudly serve to our own family—and to yours.</p>

    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
    <p>We believe in using our business as a way to love and support the people around us. The Family Cup is proud to partner with <strong>Isaiah 117 House</strong> and <strong>Foster Village Memphis</strong>—two incredible organizations supporting children entering foster care and the families who love them. Through donations, community events, and intentional giving, we hope to walk alongside these children and remind them that they are seen, supported, and never alone.</p>

    <h2>First Light Mission</h2>
    <p><strong>First Light</strong> is our signature light roast coffee created in collaboration with Dr. Beans Coffee Roasters. Every bag helps shine hope into dark moments—proceeds directly support Isaiah 117 House and the children they care for. It’s more than a coffee; it’s a cup with purpose.</p>

    <h2>A Deeper Look at Our Why</h2>
    <p>At the heart of The Family Cup is a story of love, purpose, and a deep calling to serve.</p>
    <p>I’ve spent the last 14 years as a pediatric nurse, caring for children and families at the bedside—through joy, heartache, hope, and healing. Those sacred moments have shaped who I am and how I love. They’ve also become the quiet foundation behind everything we do here at The Family Cup.</p>
    <p>What started as a dream at our kitchen table became a family mission—a way to give something meaningful back to the community that has walked with us through so many seasons of life. My husband still works full-time to help support this dream, and together with our three children (who you may spot helping in the trailer or just offering a bright smile or giggle), The Family Cup truly is a family project. Our little ones may not brew the coffee, but their joy is brewed into the heart of every cup.</p>
    <p>We didn’t create this trailer to grow a business. We created it to pour out something good. Every handcrafted drink is made with the same love and care we give to our family and to our patients. Every visit is a chance to slow down, to feel seen, to experience kindness in the smallest way.</p>
    <p>Through the work we do, and through the causes we support like Isaiah 117 House and Foster Village Memphis, our hope is to make a small difference in someone’s day—or maybe their story. That’s our why. And we’re so honored to share it with you.</p>
